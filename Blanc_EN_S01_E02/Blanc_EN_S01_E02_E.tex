\begin{enumerate}
\item[a)] The equation for uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion alone an $x$ axis is  
\[
\ddot{x} = a ,
\]
where $a$ is a constant. Show that its general solution is $x(t) = \frac{1}{2}at^2 + v_0t + x_0$ for any $v_0$ and $x_0$. Interpret these constants.

\item[b)] A salmon jumps out of a lake with initial velocity $v_0$ directed skywards. Gravity causes a constant acceleration $-g$ on the fish. Represent graphically the fish' vertical position as a function of time, as well as its speed as a function of time.

\item[c)] What's the highest the salmon will go? How much time will it spend in the air?

\emph{Numerical application:} $v_0 = 3\, {\rm m/s}$ and $g = 10\, {\rm m/s}^2$.  \\
