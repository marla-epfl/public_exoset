a) The figure shows the blocs' successive positions at regular time intervals, and these are evenly spaced. Therefore, the blocs' speed is constant and their acceleration is naught.\\
b) Let $x$ be an axis parallel to PQ and $y$ an axis perpendicular to PQ and pointing in the direction of the ship's acceleration in the second phase. The $x$ component of the velocity, $v_x$, must remain constant, since there is no acceleration along $x$. Trajectories 1 and 2, in which $v_x$ is suddenly cancelled at point Q, are therefore wrong.
After point Q, the spaceship's path must have the shape of uniformly accelerated motion, that is, a parabola. Trajectories 2, 3, and 4 are clearly not parabolic. Therefore, the only remaining solution is trajectory 5, which is parabolic from point Q onwards and compatible with a constant $v_x$.
